<p>The Chin Up Boutique was started in late 2018 by Katie and Chris Moran.  The two of them wanted to create a fun, safe space where individuals that are down on their luck
    can experience something that some would consider a luxury.  We firmly believe that fashion should not only be available to those with a high income.  Here at
    the Chin Up boutique, we partner with local Indianapolis shelters to schedule one on one appointments for individual styling.  Let's face it, we all feel a boost of self-confidence when we 
    wear an incredible ensemble.  We want to make that experience available to those currently housed at local shelters.  We operate as a consignment and thrift shop.  Please contact us via phone
    or email to schedule a time to bring in gently used clothing items for Men, Women, and Unisex. Juniors sizes are welcome as well.  Schedule an appointment with us via our scheduling section!</p>
